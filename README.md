## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository and start contributing.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   Copy the HTTPS link from the GitHub repo page, then run:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
   
   Or to name the folder something specific:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git your-folder-name
```

2. **Open the project in Unity**
   
   - Launch Unity Hub
   - Click the **Add** button (or **Open**)
   - Select **Add project from disk**
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder and select it
   - Wait for Unity to initialize the project

### Making Changes

Once you've made changes to the code:

1. **Stage your changes**
```bash
   git add .
```

2. **Commit your changes**
```bash
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

3. **Push to GitHub**
```bash
   git push origin master
```

### Tips

- Always pull the latest changes before starting work: `git pull origin main`
     - This will add the changes to particular files to your code
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test your changes before committing

### Important Notes

Cloning this repo **WILL NOT** automatically add particular initializion settings, assets, or other things we've made graphically. Our .gitignore file specifies that this repo is not to hold that stuff. Please do not change the .gitignore! The asset files will be posted in the discord (in the blender channel) and you'll only have to load them in once.
